📚 PROJECT 4: Book Recommendation 📚
We developed a book recommendation system based on collaborative filtering.

📋 Description
The aim of this project was to apply different collaborative filtering methods to recommend books to users.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contained three files: one for books, one for preferences (ratings), and one for users. The data files were downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset.

🔧 Pre-processing
We performed the following steps to prepare the data:

Removing users who give the same rating to all books they have rated.
Removing users who have rated less than 8 books.
Removing books that are rated by fewer than 8 users.
📈 Work required
We proposed recommendation methods based on collaborative filtering by testing different parameter variations (distance, k, ...).

We presented significant graphs related to the data and results.

For each proposed method, we displayed user information and presented the Top 3 recommended books for them. For each recommended book, we displayed all information related to that book.

We suggested and applied a strategy to evaluate the proposed recommendation methods in order to analyze and compare these different methods, based on several evaluation criteria.

📝 Project evaluation

The project evaluation was based on a detailed and structured notebook following the CRISP-DM method containing the description of the work done (presenting the details of the different methods used) as well as the code.
An oral presentation was also required to present the results.

🚀 Let's recommend some books! 🚀
